Skype (Unofficial)
------------------

This web app makes the Skype web version available on Ubuntu Touch
mobile devices by help of a User Agent override (mimicking Chromium
Web browser on a Ubuntu Linux desktop). Without that Skype's web
version displays a "Not available on this device yet" message on most
mobile platforms as of today.

Messaging will work, but voice and video calls will not be available.
Note that most if not all limitations will almost certainly depend on
Microsoft implementing the necessary feature (e.g. voice calls) on the
web version and the target platform.

This web app is not affiliated with Microsoft who owns Skype.
The Skype name, associated trade marks and logos and the "S" logo are
trade marks of Skype or related entities.
