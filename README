Skype (Unofficial)
------------------

This web app uses the Skype web version with a User Agent override
(mimicking Amazon Kindle Fire HDX). It makes the Skype web version
available on Ubuntu Touch mobile devices by simply working around the
Skype web version's "Not available on this device yet" message.

Messaging will work, but voice and video calls will not be available.
Note that most if not all limitations will almost certainly depend on
Microsoft implementing the necessary feature (e.g. voice calls) on the
web version and the target platform (Amazon Kindle at the moment).

This web app is not affiliated with Microsoft who owns Skype.
The Skype name, associated trade marks and logos and the "S" logo are
trade marks of Skype or related entities.
